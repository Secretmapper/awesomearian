    <p>Media is fascinating. Books, movies, art, games, music. To think how a belief, a view, an emotion, or a story, can be contained and conveyed in a particular medium is just mind-blowing - perhaps one of the most key things that distinguishes humans. The ability to connect emotionally through these is why I enjoy interacting with media so much - especially books.</p>

<p>What’s quite interesting though, is the meta aspect of them - the thought that this isn’t just an experience that was seen or viewed through a window, so to speak. Instead, another person, another human being, somewhere, sometime, decided to sit down and concoct a story that he/she would later share with the world.</p>

<p>And last Thursday, I got to meet with two such people.</p>

<p>Ma’am invited Maita Songco Salvador and Marie Yvette Concepcion-Alcazar, the authors of the Children’s books “When Zero Left Number Land” and “Letting Sunny Go” respectively.</p>

<p>I haven’t read any of the two books before, so I came to the class blind, but I really enjoyed both of them when they were read to us. “When Zero Left Number Land” had an incredibly cute story, and the book also ‘sounds’ good, having a nice rhyming pattern and a certain cadence to how it was written. Of course, the personification of numbers was a really quirky and fun sight to behold - you don’t always see a talking and judgeful ‘Nine’!</p>

<p>“Letting Sunny Go” was a much heavier story, dealing with how a child gives up her favorite toy to donate it to calamity struck children. The book served as an interesting (and I’m pretty sure effective) way to convey the concept of donating, and further more, altruism to kids. It’s a feel good story, and it does a damn good job of being one.</p>

<p>After reading the stories, the authors then shared and talked about their creations, which made for a pretty insightful one and a half hour for our class. Putting the books to a face and seeing the authors in flesh was quite a different thing.</p>

<p>Both of their inception stories were very inspirational - talking about how they got started on Children’s Literature, writing lots of stuff, finding an idea they were willing to stick with, refining, publishing, and the creative process that went along with it… It was essentially a startup story, but in this case in the context of children’s books!</p>

<p>The authors’ story of how difficult it was for them to be constantly asked to revise their story by the publisher was something that really struck with me as a game developer, as I’ve also went through the same thing. A creation is something incredibly personal, and veering off from your initial visions is something that’s always quite a challenge to do.</p>

<p>Overall the whole talk left me with a lot of inspiration - indeed the thought that maybe I can write a story too passed my mind! The whole talk showed me how the authors weren’t intimidating literature experts - rather, they were really just people who had an educational and moral story to tell the world, and published it through a dash of creativity, perseverance, and a whole lot of hard work.</p>
